# VoRAS: Vocos Retrieval and self-Augmentation for Speech

VoRAS is a model designed for fast and lightweight voice cloning built upon [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI), with the enhancement of utilizing [Vocos](https://github.com/gemelo-ai/vocos) as a replacement for the vocoder, and a restructuring of the overall model architecture to a more modern design.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> VoRAS is still in the experimental development phase.
